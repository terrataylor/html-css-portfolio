                    <h4>Your project is in safe hands</h4>
                    <p>I have been passionate about web development and software engineering for most of my life. I
                        started learning about HTML when I was 12 years old at a computer science summer camp that I was
                        fortunate enough for my parents to send me
                        too. 22 years later I have acquired a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science, a Masters Degree in
                        Information Technology and 12 years of professional and personal experience.
                    </p>

                    <p>Most of my experience has been in working with front end technologies such as HTML, CSS,
                        JavaScript, JQuery, AngularJS and ReactJS. I have also done full stack development with Java,
                        NodeJS, .NET and MySQL building SOAP and RESTful
                        web services, mostly. As technology changes, I like to keep my skills up to date by taking
                        online courses on Youtube and Udemy. You can see some of my recent courses below.
                    </p>

                    <p> </p>
                    <p>In my free time I enjoy playing video games, spending time with my husband and daughter,
                        traveling, cooking and dog training.</p>

                    <p>In her time at Temenos Terra dug in and learned to be super productive in a challenging
                        environment. She stepped up and figured out where she could add value despite these issues. Her
                        ability to work with others and help the team move
                        forward is inspiring to all. I'm hopeful that I will be able to work with her again in the
                        future.

                    <p>Terra was a phenomenal instructor. She has a way of taking difficult subjects and breaking them
                        down into understandable language. Her knowledge in a variety of Technologies provides a great
                        resource to students when challenges in
                        projects arise. She is also tremendously talented in fixing bugs that occur due to not so
                        obvious reasons.

                    <p>Terra is an extremely capable teacher. An expert in full-stack web development, Terra is adept at
                        distilling difficult concepts into manageable bites for her students. Furthermore, Terra is
                        skilled at fostering an environment in which
                        students are challenged to dive deeper into the subject matter and make discoveries for
                        themselves. In addition, Terra is incredibly patient, always willing to review subject matter at
                        the student's request. Terra's combination
                        of both real-word experience and technical expertise make her an incredible effective teacher.

                    <p>Terra Taylor is the best coding instructor I've ever had. She explains the materially clearly and
                        concisely. Her style is very engaging and inspires continual curiosity. Her patience is infinite
                        for those who struggle. She often goes
                        out of her way to personally mentor, tutor and reach out to students maybe on the margins or
                        unsure of themselves. Her good nature and positive attitude make the challenging process of
                        learning to code a pure delight. Her story
                        is incredibly inspiring, and I think she will have a long fruitful career. She will be the
                        catalyst for the success of many future students.
